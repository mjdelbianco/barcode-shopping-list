# Listy - your shopping buddy

Create shopping lists in a fun and easy way by scanning the barcode of the product!

A simple yet effective shopping list app built in React Native using the (extremely limited in free requests :joy: ) Barcode Lookup API.

### :star: How does it work

Simply create a list with a desired title, and start scanning your products. In case there is no barcode to scan (fruits, veggies,...) you can simply input the products manually.
Listy saves you the trouble of creating lists over and over again, why don't you create a list of favorite/most frequent items you buy and update it as you go!

You just finished the milk from the fridge? :anguished: It is possible that you will forget to buy it when you are out and about :confused: STOP! Scan the barcode before throwing the milk out and never go without milk again

### :star: How to get it up and running!

:exclamation: To run Listy on your computer/simulator you need to have Android Studio and SDK Tools installed, configured and ready to run.

:exclamation: Also, get your API key at the Barcode Lookup website and store it in your `.env ` that you will create at the root of the project

First install your dependencies to set up your environment `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Then run `npm start` or even better `npm start -- --reset-cache`.
